            <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Earlier this semester, you wrote a short essay on why you decided to become an engineer.  
                Reflect back on that essay - how has your vision changed?  Why choose engineering?
                </p>

<h3 class="pro_head">Vision</h3>

<p class="para">Reflecting on my essay, a few things have changed.
    In my essay, I mentioned being undecided on what I want to specialize in
    with a computer science degree. I have decided to specialization in 
    cyber security/IT. 
</p>

<h3 class="pro_head">Why choose engineering?</h3>

<p class="para">I chose engineering because it's the future. 
Companies everywhere need a computer scientist because we're relying more on technology then 
ever before. I enjoy problem solving and technology, so computer science would be
a great career for me. Engineering is about problem solving to make the world a better place. 
</p>

<h3 class="pro_head">Level of Interest</h3>

<p class="para">What excites me the most is getting to change the world
    through technology. When you work in tech you have to stay up to date with 
    every technological advancement. As a computer scientist I will constantly be learning.
    I'm interested in creating pratical solutions.
