                <p>To be a successful engineer you need to be able to communicate, work
                    in a team, and problem solve. Working in a diverse team can help with 
                    design bias. Engineering is a team effort and to have an effective team you
                    need to be able to communicate. Depending on your field lives could be at stake and
                    you don't want faulty designs in the hands of the public. Solving the worlds problems
                    needs people who are analytical, logical, and pay attention to details. 
                    An effective leader is needed for a team to be successful. Leaders need to have a plan
                    for the team to execute.

                  Before graduation, I would like to have worked a few internships to discover what I like
                  and what I don't like. With these internships I hope to find a job within a company I interned for
                  to have a job lined up post graduation. Technology is constantly changing which means I have to adapt 
                  to that atmosphere. In five to ten years post graduation, I would like to be working the same job, but
                  with a promotion at some point. Eventually, I would like to start my own company and be my own boss.  
                  I may choose to go back to school to get my MBA or Masters to start my company or level up in my job.
